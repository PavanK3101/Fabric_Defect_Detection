# 🧵 Fabric Defect Detection (Multi-Class)

An end-to-end Machine Learning model designed to automate quality control in textile manufacturing. This project utilizes Computer Vision to identify and classify various types of fabric defects, ensuring higher production standards and reducing manual inspection fatigue.

## 📖 Project Overview
Manual inspection in the textile industry is often slow and prone to human error. This project implements a high-performance image classification/detection pipeline to categorize fabric anomalies. 

### **Key Features:**
* **Multi-Class Classification:** Detects specific defect types (Holes, Stitches, Stains, etc.).
* **Automated Pipeline:** From raw image preprocessing to model inference.
* **High Precision:** Optimized to reduce "False Pass" rates in manufacturing lines.

## 📊 Dataset Information
The model is trained using the **[Multi-class Fabric Defect Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/multi-class-fabric-defect-detection-dataset)**.

**Classes included:**
1.  **Hole** - Physical punctures in the fabric.
2.  **Horizontal Defect** - Weaving errors along the weft.
3.  **Vertical Defect** - Weaving errors along the warp.
4.  **Stitches** - Small lumps or tangles in the yarn.
5.  **Stain** - Discoloration or liquid damage.
6.  **Normal** - Defect-free fabric.
